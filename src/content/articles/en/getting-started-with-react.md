React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this article, we'll explore the core concepts and best practices.

## Key Concepts

1. Components
- Building blocks of React applications
- Reusable and modular
- Can be functional or class-based

2. Props
- Pass data between components
- Immutable and read-only
- Enable component reusability

3. State
- Manage component data
- Can be updated using setState
- Triggers re-rendering when changed

## Getting Started

To start with React, you'll need Node.js installed. Then you can create a new project using:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will set up a new React project with all the necessary configurations.
